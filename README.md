## Overview

A Java WebRTC **signaling server** implementation for [unisockets](https://github.com/alphahorizonio/unisockets) to allow nodes to discover each other and exchange candidates. The signaling server is not involved in any actual connections between clients.

For more information on the signaling protocol as well as more implementations, check out the [unisockets Repository](https://github.com/alphahorizonio/unisockets#signaling-protocol).
